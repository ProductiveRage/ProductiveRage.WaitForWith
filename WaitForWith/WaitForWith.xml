            Extension methods for Tasks that return values that provide functionality similar to Task.WhenAll except that the return values are accessible in a Tuple, making them easy to retrieve (when using Task.WhenAll with Tasks that return different result types,
            the options are to access the original Tasks' Result values or to call it and explicitly set its TResult type parameter to object and cast the items in the returned array to the appropriate types - even if Task.WhenAll is used with Tasks that all return
            the same type, there is potential for error in it returning an array because calling code could try to access an item outside the bounds of the array and fail at runtime, which is not possible if these methods are used because a Tuple of values is
            returned instead of an array).

            the the other results). This method optionally takes a CancellationToken - if this is set before the Tasks complete then an OperationCanceledException will be raised. Ideally, this parameter would never be given a value and, if cancellation is required
            then the CancellationToken would have been shared between whatever provided each of the Tasks originally but sometimes this is not feasible and the optional argument here may be convenient (note that setting it will cancel the Task returned by this
